# ui_blackbar

Created to allow godot use `Expand` with `canvas_item` yet allowing UI to expand freely over letterbox -
while limiting rendered stuff's aspect ratio (despite it still being rendered), so outside of map isn't visible. 

this Simply hides extra sides around display, so it's not a perfect solution.
