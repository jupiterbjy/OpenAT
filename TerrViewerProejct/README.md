You need to copy audio and texture files into corresponding locations.

# Copying Textures

Copy all contents of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Armada Tanks\BaseT\Texture` into `Textures/Raw/`.

NEVER fix upper case extention, despite it looks weird.

# Copying Sounds

Copy `a_mouseover.wav` and `a_mouseclick.wav` in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Armada Tanks\BaseT\Sound`
into `SoundSystem/Sounds/`.
